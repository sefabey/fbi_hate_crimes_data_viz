## Introduction
This document will recreate the Figure 1 from the 'High Times for Hate Crimes' paper [@king-2013-HighTimesHate-c]. A screenshot of the plot is provided below ![Figure 1, King and Sutton, 2013](assets/ks_static.png)

This is a time series line chart, illustrating the daily count of anti-white hate crimes recorded in the FBI dataset in 1992. We observe a sudden spike following the riots which followed the acquittal of officers in [Rodney King case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_King). The spike decays rapidly; however, the increase in anti-white hate crime rates persists for a couple of weeks. Pre-incident average line is also provided for comparison and it suggests the national hate-crime were increased temporarily until they returned to normal in 6 weeks. The authors do not provide data nor the code.

## Sub-tasks

The sub-tasks to recreate the graph are as follows:

- Find the data of hate crimes during 1992 on FBI website.
- Import and process the data. 
- Calculate pre-incident mean.
- Reproduce the graph. 


```{r, warning=F, message=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(lubridate)
```


```{r}
load(here::here("/data/open_ICPSR/ucr_hate_crimes_1992_2017_rda/ucr_hate_crimes_1992_2017.rda"))
```


Lets check the data by creating a time series plot for the yearly aggregated number of hate crime incidents in the US.

```{r yearly_aggregated_data, fig.height=8, fig.width=8}

ucr_hate_crimes_1992_2017 %>% 
  as.tibble() %>% 
  filter(!is.na(bias_motivation_offense_1)) %>% 
  select(contains("year")) %>% 
  count(year) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=n))+
  geom_line(size=0.8)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1992,2017,1), minor_breaks = NULL) +
  scale_y_continuous(label=comma, breaks = seq(0,10000, 1000), limits = c(0,10000), minor_breaks = NULL)+
  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_rc()+
  labs(title = "Hate Crime Incidents in the US, 1992-2019",
       y="Number of Hate Crime Incidents",
       subtitle = "Source: FBI Hate Crime Statistics",
       caption = "Hate Lab, by @SefaOzalp, 2019"
       )+
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(size = 12))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust = 1))

```

This looks good. We immediately see the peak following 9/11. Looking at the whole data, we also observe a fluctuating trend, an initial increase which is followed by a declining trend after 9/11 and finally an increase since 2014.

## Calculate the pre-riot mean

Lets now focus our attention on 1992. This chunk will calculate the mean number of hate incidents per day in 1992.  


```{r pre-riot mean}

preriot_mean <- ucr_hate_crimes_1992_2017 %>% 
  as.tibble() %>% 
  filter(year==1992) %>%
  filter(bias_motivation_offense_1 %in% "anti-white") %>% 
  select(contains("date")) %>% 
  count(date) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(date)) %>% 
  mutate(date=lubridate::ymd(date)) %>% 
  filter(date<lubridate::dmy("30-04-1992")) %>% 
  summarise(mean(n)) %>% 
  pull

preriot_mean
```


## Reproduce the Figure from King and Sutton 2013

Now that I have calculated the pre-riot mean as 3.333, last step is to reproduce the figure. 

```{r king&sutton plot, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
ucr_hate_crimes_1992_2017 %>% 
  as.tibble() %>% 
  filter(year==1992) %>%
  mutate(date=lubridate::ymd(date)) %>% 
  filter(bias_motivation_offense_1 %in% "anti-white") %>% 
  filter(!is.na(date)) %>% 
  count(date) %>% 
  right_join( tibble(date=seq.Date(lubridate::dmy("01-01-1992"), lubridate::dmy("31-12-1992"), by="day"))) %>% 
  mutate(n=ifelse(is.na(n), 0, n)) %>% 
  mutate(preriot_mean=preriot_mean) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date))+
  geom_line(aes(y=n, colour="Anti-White"), size=0.8)+
  geom_line(aes(y=preriot_mean, colour="Pre-riot Average"), size=1)+
  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_rc()+
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b-%y", 
               limits = c(lubridate::dmy("01-01-1992"), lubridate::dmy("31-12-1992")),
               expand=c(0,0))+
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,60), breaks = seq(0,60,10),minor_breaks = NULL)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+
  annotate(geom="text", x=lubridate::dmy("30-06-1992"), y=55, label="May 1, 1992\nLAPD Officers acquitted\nin Rodney King case\ntwo days earlier,\non April 29." )+
  annotate(geom="point", lubridate::dmy("01-05-1992"), y=55, size=8, shape=21, fill="transparent")+
  scale_colour_manual(
                      # breaks = c("Anti-White", "Pre-riot Average"),
                      values = c("Anti-White"="black", "Pre-riot Average"="grey73")
                      ) +
    labs(title = "Anti-White Hate Crimes in the US, 1992",
         y="Number of Hate Crime Incidents",
         subtitle = "Source: FBI Hate Crime Statistics",
         caption = "Hate Lab, by @SefaOzalp, 2019",
         colour="Line"
       )+
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(size = 12))+
  NULL
# ggsave(ks_plot,filename = "ks_plot.pdf",device = cairo_pdf,width = 8, height = 6)
```

## Explore Seasonality in 1992

Final step in this document is to explore seasonality in 1992 and detrend the data if necessary. The figure above, which is daily aggregated, does not reveal a seasonality pattern. Furthermore, we do not observe a increase/decrease trend, except the spike following LA riots. Below by visualising data in monthly and quarterly aggregates, I will explore if seasonality and a trend exists in 1992 data. 

### Monthly Aggregate Plot

```{r 1992 monthly aggregate, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
hc_quarter_92 <- ucr_hate_crimes_1992_2017 %>% 
  as.tibble() %>% 
  filter(year==1992) %>%
  mutate(date=lubridate::ymd(date)) %>% 
  filter(bias_motivation_offense_1 %in% "anti-white") %>% 
  filter(!is.na(date)) %>% 
  count(date) %>% 
  right_join( tibble(date=seq.Date(lubridate::dmy("01-01-1992"), lubridate::dmy("31-12-1992"), by="day"))) %>% 
  mutate(n=ifelse(is.na(n), 0, n)) %>% 
  mutate(month=month(date), quarter=quarter(date)) %>% 
  group_by(month, quarter) %>% 
  summarise(n_month=sum(n)) %>% 
  ungroup() 
  

preriot_mean_month <- hc_quarter_92 %>% 
  # filter(month %in% c("January", "February", "March", "April")) %>% 
  filter(month <=4) %>% 
  summarise(mean(n_month)) %>% 
  pull


hc_quarter_92 %>% 
  mutate(month= dmy( paste("01",month, "1992",sep = "-"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=month))+
  geom_line(aes(y=n_month, colour="Anti-White"), size=0.8)+
  # geom_point(aes(y=n_month))+
  geom_line(aes(y=preriot_mean_month, colour="Pre-riot Average"), size=1)+
  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_rc()+
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%d-%b-%y", 
               limits = c(lubridate::dmy("01-01-1992"), lubridate::dmy("31-12-1992")),
               expand=c(.01,0), minor_breaks = NULL)+
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,300), breaks = seq(0,300,50),minor_breaks = NULL)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+
  annotate(geom="text", x=lubridate::dmy("30-06-1992"), y=255, label="May 1, 1992\nLAPD Officers acquitted\nin Rodney King case\ntwo days earlier,\non April 29." )+
  annotate(geom="point", lubridate::dmy("01-05-1992"), y=295, size=8, shape=21, fill="transparent")+
  scale_colour_manual(
                      breaks = c("Anti-White", "Pre-riot Average"),
                      values = c("Anti-White"="black", "Pre-riot Average"="grey73")
                      ) +
    labs(title = "Monthly Anti-White Hate Crimes in the US, 1992",
         y="Number of Hate Crime Incidents",
         x="Month",
         subtitle = "Source: FBI Hate Crime Statistics",
         caption = "Hate Lab, by @SefaOzalp, 2019"
       )+
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(size = 12))+
  NULL
```


### Quarterly Aggregate Plot
```{r 1992 quarterly aggregate, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
hc_quarter_92 %>% 
  group_by(quarter) %>% 
  summarise(n_quarter=sum(n_month)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=quarter))+
  geom_line(aes(y=n_quarter), size=0.8)+
  # geom_point(aes(y=n_month))+
  # geom_line(aes(y=preriot_mean_month, colour="Pre-riot Average"), size=1)+
  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_rc()+
  # scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%d-%b-%y", 
  #              limits = c(lubridate::dmy("01-01-1992"), lubridate::dmy("31-12-1992")),
  #              expand=c(.01,0), minor_breaks = NULL)+
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,600), breaks = seq(0,600,100),minor_breaks = NULL)+
  # theme(axis.text.x = element_text( hjust = 1,angle = 45))+
  # annotate(geom="text", x=lubridate::dmy("30-06-1992"), y=255, label="May 1, 1992\nLAPD Officers acquitted\nin Rodney King case\ntwo days earlier,\non April 29." )+
  # annotate(geom="point", lubridate::dmy("01-05-1992"), y=295, size=8, shape=21, fill="transparent")+
  # scale_colour_manual(
  #                     breaks = c("Anti-White", "Pre-riot Average"),
  #                     values = c("Anti-White"="black", "Pre-riot Average"="grey73")
  #                     ) +
    labs(title = "Quarterly Anti-White Hate Crimes in the US, 1992",
         y="Number of Hate Crime Incidents",
         x= "Quarter",
         subtitle = "Source: FBI Hate Crime Statistics",
         caption = "Hate Lab, by @SefaOzalp, 2019"
       )+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = c("Q1-1992", "Q2-1992","Q3-1992","Q4-1992"))+
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(size = 12))+
  NULL
```


Looking at  both monthly and quarterly aggregated data, we do not observe a seasonality or a overall trend except the in May 1992. Therefore, there it does not make sense to to detrend the data using months or quarters.
