## Introduction
This document will recreate the Figure 1 from the 'High Times for Hate Crimes' paper [@king-2013-HighTimesHate-c]. A screenshot of the plot is provided below ![Figure 1, King and Sutton, 2013](assets/ks_static.png)

This is a time series line chart, illustrating the daily count of anti-white hate crimes recorded in the FBI dataset in 1992. We observe a sudden spike following the riots which followed the acquittal of officers in [Rodney King case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_King). The spike decays rapidly; however, the increase in anti-white hate crime rates persists for a couple of weeks. Pre-incident average line is also provided for comparison and it suggests the national hate-crime were increased temporarily until they returned to normal in 6 weeks. The authors do not provide data nor the code.

## Sub-tasks

The sub-tasks to recreate the graph are as follows:

- Find the data of hate crimes during 1992 on FBI website.
- Import and process the data. 
- Calculate pre-incident mean.
- Reproduce the graph. 


```{r, warning=F, message=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
```


```{r}
load(here::here("/data/open_ICPSR/ucr_hate_crimes_1992_2017_rda/ucr_hate_crimes_1992_2017.rda"))
```


Lets check the data by creating a time series plot for the yearly aggregated number of hate crime incidents in the US.

```{r}
ucr_hate_crimes_1992_2017 %>% 
  as.tibble() %>% 
  filter(!is.na(bias_motivation_offense_1)) %>% 
  select(contains("year")) %>% 
  count(year) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=n))+
  geom_line(size=0.8)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1992,2017,1), minor_breaks = NULL) +
  scale_y_continuous(label=comma, breaks = seq(0,10000, 1000), limits = c(0,10000), minor_breaks = NULL)+
  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_rc()+
  labs(title = "Hate Crime Incidents in the US, 1992-2019",
       y="Number of Hate Crime Incidents",
       subtitle = "Source: FBI Hate Crime Statistics",
       caption = "Hate Lab, by @SefaOzalp, 2019"
       )+
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(size = 12))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45))

```

This looks good. We immediately see the peak following 9/11. Looking at the whole data, we also abserve a fluctuating trend, an initial increase which is followed by a declining trend after 9/11 and finally an increase since 2014.

## Calculate the pre-riot mean

Lets now focus our attention on 1992. This chunk will calculate the mean number of hate incidents per day in 1992.  
```{r pre-riot mean}

preriot_mean <- ucr_hate_crimes_1992_2017 %>% 
  as.tibble() %>% 
  filter(year==1992) %>%
  filter(bias_motivation_offense_1 %in% "anti-white") %>% 
  select(contains("date")) %>% 
  count(date) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(date)) %>% 
  mutate(date=lubridate::ymd(date)) %>% 
  filter(date<lubridate::dmy("30-04-1992")) %>% 
  summarise(mean(n)) %>% 
  pull

preriot_mean
```



## Reproduce the Figure from King and Sutton 2013

Now that 

```{r king&sutton plot, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
ucr_hate_crimes_1992_2017 %>% 
  as.tibble() %>% 
  filter(year==1992) %>%
  mutate(date=lubridate::ymd(date)) %>% 
  filter(bias_motivation_offense_1 %in% "anti-white") %>% 
  filter(!is.na(date)) %>% 
  count(date) %>% 
  right_join( tibble(date=seq.Date(lubridate::dmy("01-01-1992"), lubridate::dmy("31-12-1992"), by="day"))) %>% 
  mutate(n=ifelse(is.na(n), 0, n)) %>% 
  mutate(preriot_mean=preriot_mean) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date))+
  geom_line(aes(y=n, colour="Anti-White"), size=0.8)+
  geom_line(aes(y=preriot_mean, colour="Pre-riot Average"), size=0.9)+
  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_rc()+
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%d-%b-%y", 
               limits = c(lubridate::dmy("01-01-1992"), lubridate::dmy("31-12-1992")),
               expand=c(0,0))+
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,60), breaks = seq(0,60,10),minor_breaks = NULL)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+
  annotate(geom="text", x=lubridate::dmy("30-06-1992"), y=55, label="May 1, 1992\nLAPD Officers acquitted\nin Rodney King case\ntwo days earlier,\non April 29." )+
  annotate(geom="point", lubridate::dmy("01-05-1992"), y=55, size=8, shape=21, fill="transparent")+
  scale_colour_manual(
                      breaks = c("Anti-White", "Pre-riot Average"),
                      values = c("Anti-White"="black", "Pre-riot Average"="grey73")
                      ) +
    labs(title = "Anti-White Hate Crimes in the US, 1992",
         y="Number of Hate Crime Incidents",
         subtitle = "Source: FBI Hate Crime Statistics",
         caption = "Hate Lab, by @SefaOzalp, 2019"
       )+
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(size = 12))+

  # geom_hline(yintercept=3,  color="grey66", size=1, show.legend = T)+
  NULL

# ggsave(ks_plot,filename = "ks_plot.pdf",device = cairo_pdf,width = 8, height = 6)
```
