  abstract = {Objectives: A number of critics predicted that President Donald Trump's divisive rhetoric during the presidential campaign and his subsequent election would embolden hate crime perpetrators, thereby contributing to more hate crimes. Media commentators have dubbed this the Trump Effect. This Essay empirically evaluates the relationship between President Trump's rise to power and the recent increase in reported hate crimes.
Methods: We use time series analysis and panel regression techniques to examine the relationship between President Trump's election and trends in reported hate crime rates at the national and local level from 1992 through 2017.
Results: President Trump's election was associated with a statistically significant surge in reported hate crimes across the United States, even when controlling for alternative explanations. Counties that voted for President Trump by the widest margins in the presidential election experienced the largest increases in reported hate crimes.
Conclusions: Using the data from this study, we offer a novel theory that builds on the existing literature on the causes of hate crimes. We hypothesize that it was not just Trump's inflammatory rhetoric throughout the political campaign that caused hate crimes to increase. Rather, we argue that it was Trump's subsequent election as President of the United States that may have validated this rhetoric in eyes of perpetrators and fueled the hate crime surge.},
